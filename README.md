# GOG-Games.to-Monitor
 <h2>Monitor website for new games</h2>
 
Run **notifier.bat** (must be in the same folder of .py and .ico files)

If the script detects changes in the site, you will be notified by a Windows notification

To stop the process, kill the 'python' and 'python (32 bit)' process.

Change the **DELAY_TIME** value in the .py file to set the time between refreshes (default: 180s)


Sometimes, it gets a false positive.. It's a script written in 10 minutes.. Contribute!
